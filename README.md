## General advice
- Find your "why", why you want to work at FAANG.
- Move to next topic when you can solve the problems from similar topic.

## How to solve?
1. Read the problem description (do not think to code)
2. Try to question yourself (is it ASCII or Unicode), what is the Max value, is there a difference between capital letter or small letters
3. Draw some examples on paper (with corner cases)
4. Thinking about the solution in mind (and evaluate complexity)
5. Think better solution
6. Write code in paper
7. Debug your code in paper (test with new corner cases)
8. Rewrite in IDE
9. Then in 10% of cases, your code should work by just one attempt :)

- If you trying to solve the problem more than 1 hour, look the best solutions. And mark as "TODO"
- Write your explanation on comments, to make your solution obvious when you read it next time.
